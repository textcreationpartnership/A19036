            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BELOVED, the chiefeſt care of euery man in this life ſhould be how hee may glorifie God, and ſaue his ſoule; and there is great reaſon it ſhould bee ſo; for as he is the fountaine from whence all good

Therefore the Angels, thoſe<note place="margin">Iohn 11. 4.</note> glorious Creatures, out of their zeale to their Creator, are ſwift winged Heralds to diuulge his glory, and are reſtleſſe in giuing honour<note place="margin">Iſa. 6. 3.</note> and praiſe vnto him, whoſe practiſe the Saints in all ages<note place="margin">Reu. 14. 7. 4. 8.</note> haue imitated in glorifying

            <p>If this muſt be the care of euery godly man, then ſure
<pb facs="tcp:18072:16"/> our age abounds with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny careleſſe and negligent men, which in ſtead of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God, and ſeeking the ſaluation of their ſoules, their chiefeſt care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is to honour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance themſelues in this world, as appeares by their practice &amp; proiects, which is all for pleaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,<note place="margin">Iſa. 22. 13.

<pb facs="tcp:18072:17"/> ſinfull ſecuritie, and moue vs to turne to the Lord by true and vnfaigned repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that hee may haue mercie vpon our ſoules: yet for as much as times &amp; ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are in Gods hands, &amp;<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 8.</note> that his Spirit blows where he liſts; I haue therfore in the ſtrength of my God preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to preſent vnto your conſideration <hi>The World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Looking-glaſſe,</hi> wherein hee may clearly ſee and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the world, and all worldly things to be vaine and vncertain, louing none but thoſe which are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb facs="tcp:18072:18"/> to Chriſt; and many<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> times deceiuing them alſo of their hope and expectation; ſaucing their pleaſures with gall and wormwood. For worldly proſperity proues dangerous ſnares to bring men to deſtruction; for when it fawneth moſt, then it hunteth moſt eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after our ſaluation, vnleſs wee take the better heed. Then <hi>what is a man profited if he gaine the whole world, if hee loſe his ſoule?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The life of man is ſhort,<note place="margin">Iob 14. 1.</note> and paſſeth away like a ſhadow, and that which
<pb facs="tcp:18072:18"/> worldlings enioy, they buy at hard rates; paying full deare for their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany pleaſures, which many times proue full of miſery, &amp; vexation of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>But yet alas, though we ſee the deceitfulneſſe of the world, and the miſery of it; yet we are content to be deceiued therby, &amp; ſo to fall at noone dayes when our eyes are open. Wee vſe to laugh at little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which runne vp and downe after a feather, or ſome vaine toy, till they fall downe and take harme;
<pb facs="tcp:18072:19"/> and then wee pitty their folly: But when wee ſee man, which ſhould haue reaſon to guide him, to toile ſo eagerly after theſe tranſitory things, which at laſt will deceiue him, and ſteale away his heart from godlineſſe; how ſhould wee lament his miſery?</p>
            <p>Let the conſideration hereof moue vs all to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a pearle wee are like to loſe for the gaining of theſe deceitfull vanities, that ſo at the laſt wee may be perſwaded to labour for the ſaluation of our ſoules.
<pb facs="tcp:18072:19"/> For is it not better to ſerue God, and to worke out our owne ſaluation here, that we may bee bleſſed hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; then for the loue of this baſe world to bee tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for euer and euer? Is it not better to want theſe ſinfull pleaſures, then for enioying of them, to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Hell? For what<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 8.</note> ſhall we reape of the fleſh, but corruption? And what ſhall we gaine of the Deuill for al our ſeruice, but eternal torments? And what ſhall<note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 35.</note> wee gaine of the world but ſpeedy forgetfulneſſe?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:18072:20"/>
            <p>Seeing then the loue of the world is ſo vaine and deceitfull, let vs then labour for heauen and heauenly things, and take no thought<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 14</note> for the fleſh to fulfill the luſts thereof; minding not ſo much this preſent world, as that which is to come; for this is temporary and muſt haue an end, but that is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 8.</note> and will abide for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. This muſt bee done,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 1, 2.</note> that thereby wee may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue our ſanctification; for here wee liue by faith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 7.</note> and therefore our conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> muſt bee ſutable. This

Ioh. 16. 22.</note> for our hope is certaine, and cannot deceiue vs. This is the onely way to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 18.</note> of God, and to gaine a good report among men. This will bring a ſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at laſt; God himſelfe hath pronounced, that it ſhal goe well with the iuſt,<note place="margin">Iſay 3. 10.</note> for their end ſhall bee euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 22.</note> life: For the ground of their hope is founded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 12.

This, as it will
<pb facs="tcp:18072:21"/> bring comfort when worldlings are at their wits<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 8.</note> ends, ſo alſo it yeelds an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable imployment in the meane time, while wee exerciſe our ſelues in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly<note place="margin">Col. 3. 2.</note> things. For the things<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> of this life, as they are baſe, ſo they are ſhamefull, and the end of them is death. <hi>Then what is a man profited if he gaine the whole world, and loſe his ſoule?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Spare no paines then for to gaine thy ſaluation, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and caſt away all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delights, till thou art perſwaded thy <hi>name is
<pb facs="tcp:18072:21"/> written in heauen.</hi> Wee ſee<note place="margin">Luk. 10. 20</note> worldly men will toyle &amp; labour to gaine riches, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and preferments; hope of gaine will make Raine and windie weather ſeeme faire and pleaſant. For ſhame then let not world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings diligence condemne ours, for how ſhall wee eſcape, if wee neglect ſo<note place="margin">Heb. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.</note> great ſaluation? Chriſt hath done more for vs, and ſhall wee doe nothing for our ſelues? wee ſhall loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at the end, but gaine exceedingly; then it ſhal not repent vs that wee haue
<pb facs="tcp:18072:22"/> ſowne in teares, when wee ſee we ſhall reape in ioy. As we deſire to bee members of the new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, let vs now labour to haue the aſſurance ſealed vp to our ſoules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by denying the world, and all worldly things. For the glory of the world is but like a blazing Starre, which terrifies the minde, by preſaging ruine; and the pleaſures of the world like candide Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, which deceiues the taſte, and imbitters the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke.</p>

               <p>THE time of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sauiours paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being at hand, he tells and forewarnes his Diſciples of it, that thereby he might confirme

Thou art the promiſed Seed of the Woman, in whom all the Nations of the world ſhall bee bleſſed, thou art an innocent man, and therefore oughteſt not to die; thy life is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto all men, by feeding their bodies, curing their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, teaching and inſtructing them in the wayes of godlines, therefore thou oughtſt rather reſtore the kingdome to Iſrael, and to free vs out of our capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity. But alas, <hi>Peter,</hi> thy counſell is carnall, thou vnderſtands on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the things that belong to thy owne eaſe and quietneſſe, but not the things which are of God, <hi>I was ſent to ſeek and to ſaue
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18072:29"/> the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> and am that <hi>ſcape goate,</hi> which<note place="margin">Leu. 16. 10.</note> muſt <hi>beare the iniquities of the people,</hi> and that <hi>Lambe</hi> which muſt <hi>take away the ſinnes of the world,</hi> &amp; by my death and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring muſt offer my ſelfe as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the redemption of the world; and ſo by death ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him which hath the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of death; therefore <hi>Peter,</hi> get thee behind me with thy deuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh counſel, thou art an offence, to me, and an aduerſary to my fathers wil, which hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; ſet me apart to reconcile the world vnto him: therefore if thou wilt be my Diſciple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as thou profeſſeſt thy ſelf to bee, imitate thou mee in my obedience to my Fathers Will; &amp; learn thou thy duty w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> now I teach thee, and which I will

                  <hi>If any man will come after mee, let him deny himſelf, &amp; take vp his croſſe and follow me;</hi> Teaching all thoſe which will giue vp their names vnto him, what muſt bee their practice, and whereto they muſt truſt; they muſt renounce their owne wit, pollicie, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and bee content to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure croſſes, loſſes, and much affliction, which they muſt beare cheerefully, and follow their Captaine Chriſt Ieſus in well doing, though they haue neuer ſo many pullers back, and hinderances in the way: yet they muſt imitate the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins<note place="margin">1 Sam. 6.</note> Kine, which bare the Arke of GOD, though they were milche, and had their Calues at home, yet without any tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the right hand or left,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18072:30"/> they kept on their way to <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhemeſh:</hi> So the Diſciples of Chriſt, which haue giuen vp their names vnto him, and doe beare the Arke of his law vpon their ſhoulders, though they haue many allurements of the world, the fleſh and the Deuill, to draw them backe; which are as dear vnto them as the calues were vnto the Kine; yet for all this they muſt keepe on their courſe in the pathe of a holy life and conuerſation without turning either to the right hand or left, vntill they come to <hi>Bethſhemeſh, the houſe of the Sun:</hi> for he that puts his hand to the Plough, and afterwards lookes backe, makes himſelfe vnfit for the Kingdome of God: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our bleſſed Sauiour plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tels his Diſciples what their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18072:30"/> profeſſion would coſt them, and what they ſhould looke for; that is, to bee hated of all men for his ſake, and to endure all manner of croſſes, and bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to beare them patiently, and weare them as a crown vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads: and to cary death alway before them as a ſeale vpon their fingers.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the heart of man is full of doubts, and out of ſelfe-loue is readie to call the truth of God in queſtion; our bleſſed Sauiour is carefull to fence his doctrine againſt all doubts, and to preuent all ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which carnal men can make againſt the truth thereof, as thinking it very harſh to fleſh and blood. Therefore in the 25 and 26 verſes hee anſwers a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret obiection, which ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18072:31"/> might reply vpon him, in theſe or the like words; That ſo hee ſhould loſe at leaſt the worlds goods, and perhaps his life too. To the one Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in the verſe preceding my Text, that to loſe life, was the way to find it, meaning eternall life, <hi>q. d.</hi> for the worſt that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants can doe, is but to ſend them to heauen, and the deſire to ſaue life by refuſing the croſſe, was the way indeed to loſe it, to wit, eternall life. And to the other he anſweres in the words of my Text, that the gaine of the world is nothing if it be compared with the ſoules loſſe, which he layes downe in an hypotheticall propoſition queſtion wiſe; <hi>For what is a man profited if he ſhall gaine the whole world if he loſe his ſoule?</hi> Which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18072:31"/> categorically turned is, he that winnes euen a whole world, but loſeth his owne ſoule for it, gaines not; which is confirmed by the latter part of the verſe, that there is nothing worth the ſoule, nothing equiualent to it, which he propounds queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo, becauſe in this forme a propoſition hath moſt life and power to work vpon the heart, and conſcience of the hearer. For what thing is there of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moment then the ſoule? &amp; what thing more difficult the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to weane it from the loue of the world? Therefore by this vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpeech, our Sauiour layes ſtrong battery to the hearts of worldlings to make them ſound a retreate from the eager pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite of theſe terrene things.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue made the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18072:32"/> and manner of Chriſts ſpeech the pathway leading to my text, in which I pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue theſe two maine points.</p>

               </list>
               <p>Theſe two points by GODS grace ſhall be the ſubiect of my enſuing diſcourſe, and from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to deduce this note of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation: That it is a point of<note place="margin">Obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the greateſt folly, to aduenture the loſſe of the ſoule for the gaine of the whole world.

               <p>3. Riches prepare the ſeedes and ſimples for all ſickneſſe through idleneſſe, which is the effect they produce. And ſo for want of ſtirring and action, euill, corrupt, and noyſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18072:44"/> increaſe and abound, whereby they haue no ſtomack or appetite to their meate, though they haue full tables &amp; varietie of diſhes; And ſo for want of apperite they can eate nothing; and if they doe, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſtomaches, which nouriſhes many filthy humours which cauſeth diſeaſes, which the poorer ſort are free enough from. By which it appeares, that riches doe neither preſerue health, nor cure diſeaſes when they are come. But rather it may be ſaid, <hi>That the Hals of the</hi>

               <p>5. As riches cannot keepe off pouertie, ſo they cannot pacifie a troubled conſcience, or ſecure vs from the malice of Sathan: but when GOD ſets either of them a worke, they will not feare the awfull Scepter, nor a heape of Gold, nor a ſilken garment.

               </p>
               <p>6. As they cannot pacifie a troubled Conſcience, ſo theſe terrene things, cannot make thoſe merry &amp; cheereful, which enioy them. The truth of this wee haue before ſeene in <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Haman,</hi> who were ſo vexed becauſe they could not haue what they would, that the one went ſick to bed, and the other ſo filled with diſcontent, that he was ready to eare out his owne heart, becauſe things did not ſort according to his deſire.</p>
               <p>7. As they cannot in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree profit our bodies, ſo they are leſſe able to profit our ſoules. They cannot inrich them with ſpirituall graces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

As riches cannot profit vs in our ſoules, ſo they cannot profit vs in the courſe of our life, they cannot keepe off old age, the forerunner of death, neither can they make vs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to prepare our hearts for God at our death, and ſo to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our will vnto Gods Will; Neither can they appeaſe Gods anger, reſtraine the Deuils po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but when we are panting and gaſping vpon our ſick beds, all the world will not bribe Death, but hee will tell vs hee hath a warrant from GOD to attach vs without baile or mainprice.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18072:78"/> had gotten from him, the greateſt part of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he did not murmure and repine as many of vs would haue done, but ſaid he was much beholding to them that had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him of ſo much care. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> vpon a time being fallen vpon the ſands, and ſeeing the marke and print of his body, ſaid, Lord what a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle plat of the world is nature contented with, and yet we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet the world? What a ſhame is it for vs, that the heathen ſhould condemne our greedy deſires? What would they haue done &amp; ſaid, if they might haue had as much meanes and opportunities as wee haue, to get knowledge, and to know what the Lord required at our hands? Let vs repent of our
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18072:79"/> former repining, and let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto the Lord with all our hearts; and be content to be gouerned by him in all things, for there can be no true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in any thing in this world; for elſe it may hap vnto vs, as it did vnto <hi>Dinah,</hi> who while ſhe wandred to feed her fancies vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the daughters of a ſtrange Countrey, ſhe loſt her Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among the ſons of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: ſo while wee ſeeke to fill our mindes with the profits of the world, we may loſe our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 19.</note> and make ſhip-wrack of a good conſcience, and ſo bee forced to goe away as <hi>Thamar</hi> out of her brother <hi>Ammons</hi> Chamber, with her garment rent: So thoſe worldlings which ſometimes with <hi>Demas,</hi> followed <hi>Paul,</hi> but now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18072:79"/> the world; are forced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to goe away with their garments rent, and torne. And no maruell, for if they will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture through the thornes and buſhes of worldly cares to get worldly promotion, it is no maruell if their zeale be abated and quenched, their courage for the performance of holy things cooled, their faith bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, their knowledge withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, their humility defaced, and the whole grament of piety rent in pieces. For if with <hi>Siſerah</hi> we looke for any reſt in <hi>Iaels</hi> tent, we ſhall be ſure to bee made faſt; ſo if we look for any ſound comfort in the world, we ſhall be ſure to ſpeed as ill as <hi>Siſerah</hi> did; &amp; 'tis a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to one but our ſinceritie and pietie will be nayled to the earth before wee
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18072:80"/> be aware. And ſo by longing after the pottage of the world we loſe our birth-right as <hi>Eſau</hi> did. Therefore ſeeing Gods loue or hatred is not knowne by the hauing or want of theſe outward things, therefore let vs deſire the Lord to weane our hearts from the things of the world, and to giue vs quiet mindes and thankfull hearts. But Lord, though we are full of impatience, and doubting of thy Prouidence, Mercy, and Goodneſſe, and ſo ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what thou haſt done for vs all our dayes, yet we pray thee forget not thy ſelfe, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a God ſtill to doe vs good, and if want come, then to keep our faith firme and ſtrong in thy Prouidence; if ſickneſſe, &amp; aduerſity come, keepe our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18072:80"/> entire; if riches and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come, keepe our zeale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenced. Remember wee pray thee, whereof wee bee made, from the earth we come, on the earth wee liue, delighting in earthly things, and at laſt vnto the earth wee ſhall returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>Therefore, ſeeing heauenly things cannot come from ſo vile a matter, and our earthly nature cannot bee changed but by thy heauenly Spirit, we pray thee rouze vp our dead affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and make vs to place our hearts onely vpon thee, giue vs grace to vſe and imploy our riches to thy honour, and to purchaſe vnto our ſelues the meanes of grace with them, that ſo we paſſing the time of our pilgrimage in thy feare, we
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18072:81"/> may die in thy fauour, reſt in thy peace, and riſe againe by thy power, which grant vnto vs for the Lord Ieſus ſake.

               <p>4. Laſtly, as we muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in our calling, ſo wee muſt continually pray vnto God to preſerue vs from the whoriſh woman, that ſo being

If this were duely thought vpon, men and women would bee afraid to commit it, though neuer ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, for feare Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould ouertake them in the very act, as they did <hi>Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Cosby.</hi> What a filthy thing is it for a Child of God, a Member of Chriſt, and a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18072:111"/> the onely meanes to make him ſpeak of ſenſe, is to tel him that there is good Wine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming home from Spaine or France, and then he will be ſure to prepare him a doublet a quarter wider in the waiſt then his former, that he may powre the wine downe the more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into his panch, which gapes like hell for Wine and ſtrong drinke, and then when is belly is full of Wine, and his head void of wit, then you ſhall ſee him in his right cue, belching out oathes againſt God, and ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing at the Magiſtrate, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and queſtioning of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State, too high for his ſhallow wit to reach vnto; ſo that by this meanes hee is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fit to ſerue God, nor to do any profit vnto the common

                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> makes mention of certaine men, who in the midſt of their cups reuiled their King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> in a very reproachfull manner, and being conuicted of their miſdemeanor, &amp; brought before the King, they ſtood mute, hauing nothing to ſay for themſelues; at laſt, ſeeing they could not deny the fault, nor defend it, one of them more bold then the reſt, ſtept forth and confeſſed truth; ſaying, O King it is true we ſpake much euill of thee, and ſhould haue ſpoke much more if our Wine
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18072:112"/> had not failed vs. By which we may ſee that drunkenneſſe is accompanied with backbiting and ſlandering.</p>

Fourthly, the badge of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; we will make good all theſe by examples.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18072:114"/> his owne ſonne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is the confuſion of honeſty, becauſe whoſoeuer is tainted with this ſinne; he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled from the company of good men, and is ſubiect to ill report.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what can there bee more filthy then a drunken man, whoſe mouth ſtinkes, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy trembles, tongue prates, and diſcouers all his ſecrets, many times to his great diſgrace.</p>
               <p>The ancient <hi>Romanes</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of this ſinne of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe painted it out in this ſort. Firſt, they pictured the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of a boy, next they painted a horne in his hand, &amp; vpon his head they ſet a crown of glaſſe; they pictured him a Child, to ſhew that drunkenneſſe makes a man Childiſh, and vnfit for any imployment of waight,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18072:114"/> they gaue him a horne in his hand, to ſhew that he is alwaies publiſhing his own ſecrets, and they crowned him with glaſſe, to ſhew that he boaſts of his riches, when he is but a poore man. Vpon which I inferre, that drunkenneſſe is hurtfull to all eſtates, for if a poore man bee a Drunkard; he ſhall neuer bee rich: If a rich man bee a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, he ſhall quickly conſume his ſubſtance; if he bee a young man it will infect his youth, that there will be little hope of him, and if an old man, then hee is paſt hope.</p>

               <p>The pleaſures of the eye are ſuch, as are taken in beholding vaine obiects, as Stage-playes, Enterludes, Cock-fighting, Beare-baiting, Bull-baiting, and any other vaine delight, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer; we will ſay ſomething of each, that thereby wee may diſcouer the vanitie of theſe ſinfull delights.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:18072:116"/>
               <p>We will begin with Stage playes.</p>
               <p>What profit and content can they bring vs, which for the moſt part tend to the diſhonor of God, and nouriſhing of vice, with a manifeſt loſſe of time, which wee are commanded to redeeme, and ſpend in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of GOD for our ſoules good? but at Stage-playes all the parts of our bodyes are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about ſinfull obiects, the eye to behold vanity, and filthineſſe in wanton ſhewes, and vncomely geſtures, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing, kiſſing, or other wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton toying, whereby young people are ſtirred vp to luſt, &amp; haue their hearts filled with many vncleane cogitations; with our eares vpon the Stage manie times wee heare the

                  </note> of Players ſerue for no other vſe, but to moue the fleſh to luſt and vncleanneſſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Councill of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> and Synode of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> it was enacted, that no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man or woman ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to Playes, and Enterludes, where nothing but blaſphemy, ſcurrillity, and other filthineſſe is maintained. Therefore thoſe which maintaine them, and countenance them with their preſence, doe communicate with them in their ſinnes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ſhould hate &amp; reproue the vnfruitfull workes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>The pleaſures which men take in theſe ſinfull recreations are many, as may appeare by the time they waſt and ſpend in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18072:118"/> them, ſomtime turning nights into dayes, and ſo making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation to bee a vocation; if they had but halfe ſo much care for their ſoules health, wee might well ſay they are good Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Another pleaſurable ſinne which men delight in, is laſciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dancing, which as it is vſed, or rather abuſed by the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons of our time, it is the gate leading to whoredome, and an incitement to all vncleanneſſe, and yet (the more is the pitie) many men and women (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe well affected) thinke it an Ornament to their Children to be skilled in this wanton ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed and allured to all manner of filthineſſe, which mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it ſelfe is ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18072:118"/> and needs no allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Therefore I conclude, that all leud, wanton, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciuious dancing is not onely vnlawfull, but alſo a great meanes to encreaſe much wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, and filthineſſe: For our feet were not giuen vs; to trip like Rammes, skip like Goates, leape like madde men, but that being bought with a price we ſhould glorifie GOD in our mortall bodies.</p>
               <p>Oh but may ſome ſay, this is too great preciſeneſſe, doth not <hi>Salomon</hi> ſay, <hi>There is a time to dance?</hi> therefore it is not ſo vnlawfull as you would make vs beleeue. Vnto which I anſwer, <hi>Salomon</hi> doth not meane by this place, that there is any time for a filthy and prophane mixt dancing of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18072:119"/> together; but that dancing he ſpeakes of, is reioycing of the heart, in praiſing GOD, as may appeare by the context, <hi>There is a time to mourne, and a time to dance;</hi> that is, as there is a time to mourne for our ſins, ſo there is a time to dance or reioyce for the vnſpeakeable mercies ſhewed vnto vs in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, in the pardoning of our ſinnes. But I would not ſo be vnderſtood, as if I diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended all dancing; for then I ſhould ſeeme to croſſe the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Lords people in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.</note> time, for <hi>Dauid</hi> danced before the Arke praiſing God; and when the Iſraelites were<note place="margin">Exod. 15.</note> paſſed ouer the red Sea, they danced and praiſed God. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if our dancing were like theirs, we might very lawfully
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18072:119"/> dance alſo: they danced for ioy, and thankſgiuing to GOD, but many of vs for vaine glory, to pleaſe our ſelues; but that wee may put a period to this point, we doubt not but that men &amp; women may lawfully dance for the recreation, and health of their bodies, and to expreſſe their reioycing, and cheere the minde, prouided, that each ſexe modeſtly and ſparingly dance by themſelues without any fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy geſtures, or vnbeſeeming behauiour.</p>
               <p>The next delight, where men vſe to pleaſe themſelues, is in Cock-fighting, Beare-bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Bull-baiting, and the like. Alas, what a miſery is this, to ſport our ſelues to torment and vexe the poore Creatures, which are ſubdued vnder vanity
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18072:120"/> for our ſinnes? They were not put vnder our feet, to that end, that we ſhould triumph in their miſery, and if we wrong them, God, that taketh it as done to himſelfe, will puniſh it; (for doe not we ſee that men thinke themſelues wronged in their cattell, and are vſed to reuenge their wrongs, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did the wrongs of his ſeruants by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nun</hi>) Now theſe Creatures are Gods ſeruants, and in their kind doe ſet forth the glory of God, therefore wee are not to take pleaſure to ſee them rend, and teare, and hurt, and maime one another; for this is to imitate the Deuill, who reioices in the miſery of mankind. Let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration hereof moue But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and Drouers to vſe more mercy towards the poore Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18072:120"/> then many of them doe. For if we loue God, wee muſt needes loue that which hee loues and approues, now hee loues the creatures, for in his ſight they were very good, and he doth not hate the workes of his hands.</p>
               <p>And thus wee haue made a ſearch into pleaſures in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and haue examined them in particular; wherein wee haue diſcouered ſome filthy ſinfull pleaſures, not worthy to bee once heard of among thoſe which profeſſe themſelues to be the children of the moſt High. And as we haue laid open the diſeaſes, ſo we haue preſcribed Antidotes, as preſeruatiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, not doubting but the Chriſtian Reader, by Gods bleſſing, may reape ſome bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18072:121"/> We will now proceed, and ſhew how theſe benefits may be vſed, ſo that God may haue the honour, and theſe pleaſures may be bleſſed vnto vs. Which that they may be ſo, wee muſt know that there are three co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on our part to bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and kept.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we labour for the grace of iuſtification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation vnto God by faith in Ieſus Chriſt, for till wee are at peace with him, we can haue no comfort in our pleaſures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we would haue theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures lawfull &amp; ſanctified vnto vs, wee muſt take heed we doe not ouer-value the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor ſet our hearts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights vpon them, which are the Lords peculiars, but bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to eſteeme them as droſſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18072:121"/> and dung in reſpect of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt take heed that theſe pleaſures be moderated, and kept within due bounds, we muſt bee carefull to referre them to a right end, and that is the glory of GOD, and our own ſaluation, elſe if wee ſet our hearts vpon them, God may iuſtly, and yet mercifully afflict vs with his heauy hand, and lay vpon our bodies ſickneſſe, vpon our conſcience terror, vpon our reputation diſgrace, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may ſcrue vp our hearts from grouelling vpon the earth. Therefore let vs learne wiſedome to watch ouer our pleaſures, leſt they incroach vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe times wherein God is to bee worſhipped, and when we are to performe holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:18072:122"/>
               <p>Thoſe then offend which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Lords day, by ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it about their owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, though pethaps lawfull and warrantable at another time; ſo alſo they offend which pamper their bellies vpon this day, whereby they are more fit to ſleepe then to performe any holy action. Thus wee haue ſhewed how pleaſures are good in their owne nature, and how they become good vnto vs; it remaines now to ſhew how they become pul-backs to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs in our ſpirituall race, and to ſteale away our hearts from godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>The pleaſures of this life are the chiefe baits with which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and the world vſe to ſteale away our hearts from God, and the practice of godlineſſe; for

               <p>Thus if our pleaſures be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by theſe rules, we ſhall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, and ſhall receiue a bleſſing vpon our ſoules: we are now to proceed, and take notice

               <p>Vanitie in apparell is a thing ſo much eſteemed in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane age, as that many place their happineſſe in it, thinking themſelues in beſt caſe when they are braueſt, and moſt eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med when they haue gotten coſtly apparell, inſomuch that they thinke no time too much, nor coſt too great, which is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and ſpent in dreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; therefore to maintaine them in their brauery, they are ready to ſell religion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and to defile their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation: which ſinne that we may not runne headlong into, let vs in the feare of GOD

But leſt we ſhould reiect them as ſinfull in regard of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe; let vs therefore in the firſt place conſider, that there is a good and warrantable vſe of coſtly Apparell, prouided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes that they bee fitted and ſorted according to the place and calling of thoſe that weare them. For as the Lord hath made diuers eſtates and degrees of men, ſo he would haue euery one to apparell himſelfe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his degree, that thereby there might bee a difference whereby one might bee diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed

               <p>As Inferiors offend in going coſtly in their apparell, and wearing ſuch as is fit for men of

               <p>But I may ſpare my labour to ſay much in this licentious age of this point; becauſe men and women are fallen into ſuch an exceſſe of brauery, whereby all reſpect of order and degree is neglected; for whereas Chriſt reſtrained gorgious apparell to

               <p>Another euill effect of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, that as it makes them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of GOD, and all good duties, ſo it puffes them vp in pride and conceit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they ſcorne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe others, and ſo neglect their duty which they owe to their Superiours. <hi>Vaſtie</hi> knew that<note place="margin">Eſt. 1. 11, 12</note> the King was rauiſhed with her beautie, therefore ſhe grew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and proud, and would

               <p>Wee are now come to the laſt branch propoſed, and that is vaine glory, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular applauſe, which for the moſt part is ingendred out of the feces and dregs of worldly wiſedome: What profit is there in the praiſe of men? or what good can they doe vs if they magnifie and extoll vs for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18072:144"/> reſpects, if all this while we bee vile in the eyes of God? What will the praiſe of men doe vs good, when God and our owne conſcience condemne vs?

                  <hi>in their owne eyes;</hi> which woe and ſinne that we may not fall into, let vs know that God hath not giuen vs worldly wiſdom, &amp; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning, to the end wee ſhould make ſale of them, and ſet them a ſunne ſhining for vaine people to gaze at; but he hath giuen them vs, to the end that we ſhould vſe them to his glory, and the good of his Church: but ſuch is the pride of our nature, that if one man excell another in learning, wit, and elocution, preſently they ſwell with pride, and ſo forget God and themſelues, by not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring him with his gifts, and by deſpiſing his children, which peraduenture haue better hearts to God-ward then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; we all glory now a daies
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:18072:145"/> of our knowledge and wiſdom, and thinke that our ſelues are the onely men, now what may be the reaſon of this? Surely this, becauſe in times paſt the Church had many learners, and but a few teachers; now the caſe is altered, wee haue many tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and but a few learners. In ancient time it was thought there was but ſeuen wiſe men among the Greekes, and now we thinke there be not ſo many fooles among vs.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon may bee, for want of right choyce of good natures, in thoſe which are to be trained vp in learning, for the greater ſort many times are either fantaſticall, wayward, or wilfull, whoſe wits being ſtrained againſt kinde, become diſordered, contentious, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18072:146"/> ſeditious: for it is a hard thing to make that ſtraight by art, which was made crooked by nature. When learning and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is grafted in a wrangling ſtocke, which is ſtubborne and contentious, it many times proues very dangerous; for a contentious perſon hauing wit and learning, and a plauſible tongue, is able to ſet whole kingdomes by the eares.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that learning may be abuſed, let Preachers pray for wiſedome and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that they may not pleaſe men, nor pleaſe them ſelues with their learning, but that they may honour God, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bee profitable inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to his Church. But becauſe all men in generall hunt after praiſe, &amp; he is no-body now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18072:146"/> that cannot ſoare aloft, therefore Schollers are forced to ſtretch their wits, and ſet them vpon the Tenters, to pleaſe the intoxicated multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and to beate their braines, and hazard their health, and many times indanger their ſoules, to ſatisfie the curious eares of many fantaſticall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, which will be pleaſed with nothing elſe but nouelties: ſuch take great delight to come to Sermons, but not as Schollers to learne, but rather as Iudges to controule, being now grown ſo curious in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, that it is eaſier for a Cook to pleaſe a hundred mens pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, then for a Preacher to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Sermon to pleaſe a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen hearers. Some muſt needs know what God did before hee
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18072:147"/> made the world; another, who was <hi>Melchizedechs</hi> father; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether he ſhall meet his old friends and companions in heauen which might tell him of his merry conceits; ſuch a one would needs know what he ſhal do in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before he hath learned the way how to come thither; another, he is content to come to Church to heare his Miniſter, but alas, he growes weary quickly, and out of heart, his Miniſter ſpeakes no Latine, nor Greeke, and ſo he thinkes it is loſt time to heare ſuch a homely Sermon. But alas, poor ignorant ſoule! if thou wert co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to die, thou wouldſt be glad to heare thy pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> read vnto thee in plain Engliſh w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

               <p>The things then which are dangerous to the ſoule may be couched vnder theſe two heads; as there are two wayes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the body, ſo are there likewiſe two wayes of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoule:</p>

               <p>Sin is that which offers vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the ſoule; ſin is like lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that will leauen the whole lump; &amp; like poiſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wil cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt

The deuill as a ſtrong armed man, keepes rule in that ſoule which is held vnder the ſlaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſinne. Sinne though it be delightſome in the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, yet it breedeth a worme in the conſcience, which perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually vexeth it with endleſſe<note place="margin">Voluptas tranſijt, peccatum remanſit. <hi>Bern.</hi> Citò praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it quod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectat, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manet ſine fine quod cruciat. <hi>Aug.</hi> Omne pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum eſt mors animae</note> woe, and remaineth when the pleaſure is gone.

Trie and examine thy ſelfe then
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:18072:215"/> whether thou haſt forſaken ſin or no; if thou haſt not bridled thy tongue from bitter, and blaſphemous ſpeeches; if thou haſt not taught thy hands to worke without deceit, and brought thy heart to pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hypocriſie, and doe to thy neighbour as thou wouldeſt haue thy neighbor doe to thee; thou haſt not yet forſaken thy ſinne, but remaineſt ſtill in the gall of bitterneſſe, and ſo haſt neglected thy ſoules health.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond way of loſing the ſoule is by withholding from it the meanes of preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus thoſe hazzard their ſaluation that deſpiſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the powerfull preaching of the Word of God, and ſo by putting from them the Word of GOD, they iudge
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:18072:215"/> themſelues vnworthy of eternal<note place="margin">Act. 13. 46.</note> life. Thus alſo many hazzard their ſaluation by neglecting of prayer, and are careleſſe in the duties of mortification.</p>
               <p>Seeing then the ſoule is ſo excellent, and may be loſt, then let it be euery ones care to get it ſaued in the day of the Lord. To this end labour to keepe faith and a good Conſcience in<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 14.</note> all thy wayes, for faith doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and put on Chriſt; now if Chriſt be put on by faith, then he is a moſt glorious garment to couer all our filthy naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe out of Gods ſight, and an armour of proofe to defend, and protect vs from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of our ſoules, and of our bodies.</p>
               <p>A good Conſcience is a ſweet comfort in al troubles; If
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:18072:216"/> then we can reioyce in the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of a good Conſcience, wee are in a happy condition. Be conuerſant in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, let the Word of GOD dwell plentiouſly in thee; this will be as great a comfort vnto thee in al thy afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as euer it was vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> in his troubles.</p>
               <p>Be feruent in prayer; begin the day with calling vpon Gods name, and praiſing him for all the mercies thou haſt receiued; and at night let prayer bee a Key to locke thee vp vnder the protection of the Almightie.</p>
               <p>Ioyne thy ſelfe in ſocietie with thoſe that feare God; they can teach thee by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and direct thee in the wayes of Godlineſſe; and labour to exhort one another to continue conſtantly in the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:18072:216"/> feare of the Lord. Thus if wee doe, we ſhall redeeme the time for our ſoules health. But alas, how many times haue we come together, and yet haue had no care nor thought to doe one another good, for our ſoules health; but haue ſpent our time in prophane and Idle talke; letting our tongues looſe to diſcourſe of all manner of vanitie?</p>
               <p>But oh the miſeries of our times, in which there are many which are ſo farre from helping their brethren in their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that they hinder them, and by their leud examples turne them from the way of godlineſſe! Our time is ſhort, as we haue heard; and as wee behaue our ſelues here vpon earth, either in walking in the

               <p>Therfore ſeeing life or death is gained in this world, let vs giue all diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure. And ſeeing our time is but ſhort, let vs learn a point of policy of the Deuill, he knowes his time is but ſhort, therefore hee doth all the miſchiefe he can: ſo let vs on the contrary, knowing our time is ſhort, labour to doe all the good wee can for our ſoules. But if we will ſtill turne the grace of God into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by deſpiſing the riches of his mercie, in waiting for our repentance and humiliation, we ſhall at length be turned out of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:18072:217"/> theſe houſes of clay, (wherein we haue liued in much peace) as the moſt vnworthieſt wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that euer liued, and ſhall giue a ſtrict account vnto God for all the time and meanes that hee hath vouchſafed vs for our ſoules good; and if wee haue ſpent our dayes well, then wee ſhall receiue the reward of the Iuſt; but if ill, then woe vnto our ſoules that we haue ſinned; for, <hi>What is a man profited <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
